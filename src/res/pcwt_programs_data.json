      "title": "RTI Awareness Drive – Empowering Citizens Through Information",
      "description": "As part of our ongoing initiative **\"Mission Justice – Empowering Citizens\"**, **PCWT (Pulkeshinagar Community Welfare Trust)** proudly organized an **RTI Workshop** to educate citizens about their rights under the *Right to Information (RTI) Act*. The drive was held on the evening of **22nd December 2024** and saw active participation from individuals across the community who are keen to become more informed and empowered.\n\n### 📚 During the session, the speaker explained:\n\n- How to file an RTI application step-by-step.\n- Real-life success stories of how RTI brought justice.\n- The difference between central and state public authorities.\n- How RTI can be used for accessing public records, ration card issues, delay in government services, pension updates, and more.\n\nParticipants were also given sample RTI formats, practical scenarios, and contacts for guidance in drafting their applications. The emphasis was not just on filing RTIs, but also on using them **ethically and effectively**.\n\n---\n\n### 🙌 Empowering Through Knowledge\n\nThis RTI drive was part of **PCWT's broader mission** to build an *aware, empowered, and active civil society*. Through workshops like this, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap and encourage citizens—especially youth—to take charge of their rights and responsibilities.\n\nIf you missed the session but are eager to learn, **stay connected with us**. More RTI and legal empowerment workshops are coming soon.",
